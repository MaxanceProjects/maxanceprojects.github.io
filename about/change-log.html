                <ul>
                    <li>(+) Added a file called favicon.ico just in case there is the need to change code.</li>
                    <li>(+) Added some text above the change log about the logging of updates not being added in the change log. Main container of change log has features in CSS, its width is now 90% while the table has changed from a width of 90% to 100%. This change has been made to better accomodate the text above the table.</li>
                    <li>(~) Changed the name from "Change log" to "Change Log/Website History".</li>
                    <li>(~) Verified/replaced the old favicons with the new extracted folder.</li>
                    <p>Image bug fix coming in the next update, I have figured out it happened because GitHub has not registered the change of case of letters which occurred back in Alpha 2 as part of restructuring (folders renamed from "Images" to "images" for example will still appear within GitHub as "Images" and because it is case sensitive, the image does not display). Website may be down at some point. Backup will be made.</p>

                    <li>(~) Changed most folder names, and some webpage names, folders no longer have capital letters, while webpages no longer have the "portal" suffix. Instead of for example maxanceprojects.github.io/Exploring/exploring-portal.html, the URL is now maxanceprojects.github.io/exploring.html . All links should have been updated.</li>
