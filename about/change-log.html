    <p>Keep in mind that with each update, the change log is also updated, this obviously does not need be stated unless anything other than the update that is being added is changed.</p>
    <p>Note that any changes made on external documents, e.g the Maxance's Laws page on Google Docs or the Restaurant List on Google Sheets will not be featured within this log. Additions of PDFs, although will have their own distinct naming in the github update title thing (whatever it's called), unless the PDFs come in with new modifications to the code, they most likely won't be mentioned here. Minor tweaks, be they in text or for format will also not be mentioned (these are treated just like the PDFs mentioned previously). Dates of modification may or may not be written down on such documents. This only contains changes to the website's code and/or files/file structure.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>(+) Added the Geneva Conventions Purity Test</li>
                    <li>(+) Added a list of all communes in the Vaud canton, alongside with maps and flags. This page is unlisted as the links are pasted from wikipedia so it's intended for strictly personal use. There is also a pdf version of the page on the website, also unlisted.</li>
                    <li>(~) Put the Pantheons up to date (haven't done much to the Gigachad Pantheon though)</li>
                    <li>(-) Removed the games folder on the website. Everything else will just fit in the "other category." Thus, the OGVR section has been moved to Other and will probably be available in the next update.</li>
                    <li>(-) Removed the standard pages (e.g 403, 451, blank page, etc.). No need for them.</li>

                    <li>(+) Added a footnotes section on the history of the land section.</li>
                    <li>(+) Created a new MaxanceProjects email (<a href="mailto:maxanceprojects@gmail.com">maxanceprojects@gmail.com</a>) instead of the old one (15mania.squarecraft@gmail.com). As such, the website is hosted by another email address. The YouTube channel has been created.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>(+) Added a "test section" folder with a test PDF file within. Can be accessed <a href="../tests/testpdf.pdf" style="color: darkred;" target="_blank">here</a> (this is also part of the test).</li>
                    <li>(+) Added a publications section in the exploring area. A hyperlink has been added to the library section.</li>
                    <li>(~) Changed MaxanceProjects logo. New logo is red to reflect my favorite color. Old color is blue.</li>
                    <li>(~) As a result, the navbar color has been changed too so that it fits better. The links also turn red now when hovered on. Slightly tweaked positioning of links.</li>
                    <li>(~) Color of footer and "more" sections has also been updated to a more neutral gray to match the red navbar and logo.</li>
                    <li>(~) Cover image changed from the view from the Marchissy Municipal Pavillion changed to the Oujon Ruins in semi-foggy weather, much more representative of things dear to me. A caption has also been added for the first time in a while. Image has been appropriately resized (1600px x 1200px). Text on the cover image has also been changed. Finally, styling around the cover image has also been changed.</li>
                    <li>(~) Changed the profile picture and slightly resized it.</li>
                    <li>(~) Fonts on all active pages have been changed to Times New Roman (or Serif, an equivalent). I'm really changing aren't I?</li>
                    <li>(~) A lot of minor tweaks and rewrites and changes which are barely noticeable.</li>
                    <li>(-) Disabled the spooky section as well as other sections too which never got the opportunity to flourish. Tweaked some minor formatting things on that page too.</li>
                    <li>(-) OGVR section temporarily disabled.</li>
                    <li>(-) Old unused pages have been deleted, unless I still need their information to be migrated elsewhere.</li>

                    <li>(+) Added some text above the change log about the logging of updates not being added in the change log. Main container of change log has features in CSS, its width is now 90% while the table has changed from a width of 90% to 100%. This change has been made to better accomodate the text above the table.</li>

                    <p>Image bug fix coming in the next update, I have figured out it happened because GitHub has not registered the change of case of letters which occurred back in Alpha 2 as part of restructuring (folders renamed from "Images" to "images" for example will still appear within GitHub as "Images" and because it is case sensitive, the image does not display). Website may be down at some point. Backup will be made.</p>

Instead of for example maxanceprojects.github.io/Exploring/exploring-portal.html, the URL is now maxanceprojects.github.io/exploring.html . All links should have been updated.</li>
