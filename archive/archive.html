        <h4 id="chapter1">What is MLAS?</h4>
        <p>Maxance's Library and Archive System is a system created to safely contain information from the past: pictures, documents, etc. for the sake of looking back at the good times and nostalgia, as well as document protection. The project was originally launched in early 2020 as MFAS. By 2021 MFAS had changed to MLAS, and the catalogue redone.</p>
        <h4 id="chapter2">How does it work?</h4>
        <p>There are several components to the archive system. There is a catalogue which you can access with the blue button above. This gives a public index/catalogue of everything that is stored, located in a google sheet. You can review the file names, creation dates, status, and so on. The system is still in its infancy and I haven't experimented with online access and storage, which is why to actually look at the items you have to know me and talk to me in person or contact me through <a href="../about/about.html">online means</a>. I can then show up with the file or send it if it's possible, it all depends on the precautions taken for the file's safety. Once you are quickly reviewed and the status of the file is also reviewed, clearance is either granted or denied, and the viewing/sharing can take place if granted.</p> 
        <p>To send a file, use the red button above to go to the form, fill in the item's information, and upload it if you want to via the form, or send it by email, or give it in person. Afterwards the item is safely placed in MLAS custody. Key point for submission and storage: <b>As the owner, you can check the file's status every so often. MLAS is only responsible for its version of the file and does not extend its protection to your version of the file, only the submitted one. In addition, you are responsible for the file you submit, and if you chose to take someone else's stuff and sumbit it then you are responsible for any disputes. MLAS just has the responsibility of safely storing it, nothing else.</b> MLAS does not do computer backups, files should almost never exceed 500MB-1GB.</p>
        <p>Now that those two golden rules are out of the way, what happens while the file is in the archive? If an object it is stored in one of the libraries, either prefix L for library or PA for physical archive. If it is a file it is stored on one of the disks, prefix DA for digital archive. You will see these prefixes in the catalogue. For privacy and security reasons unless you own the file the exact location is not shared with you, just the fact that it's location number 2 for example. If needed copies can be made of the file either with an MLAS admin's clearance or the file owner's. Sometimes to ensure the item is in good condition it can be inspected or moved around or reviewed depending on the need.</p>
        <p>Who can access the file? It all depends on the security level, a table of which is in the catalogue. The maximum level of protection however is the admin in charge and the file owner have access. By access it is meant: the ability to view and obtain the file, as well as copy and modify it if need be.</p>
        <p><span class="text-danger">Important note: MLAS doesn't currently support file uploads. To send something, please privately arrange by email.</span></p>
