Take each ID, in the correct order, and follow the same format as this comment or the title. Just make sure to have commas until you're done and then put nothing at the end of the very last one, like this comment. Yes, you can paste HTML formatting in sans autre. The rule is always comma in a list and then nothing for the last item or it will scream at you."
