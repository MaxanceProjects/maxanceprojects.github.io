    <h3>Important information</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Geneva Conventions Purity Test. The Four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Three Additional Protocols are a cornerstone of international humanitarian law. I have studied the subject for three weeks in New York and, after a suggestion from my good friend Eli, as well as a lot of time (javascript is intimidating guys I swear I'm not just lazy) I have created this test. A lot of this has been inspired by the summary of the Geneva Conventions written by myself and folks I worked with in New York at the time.</p>
    <p>Obviously with everything going on in the world right now (this test has been published in summer of 2024) international humanitarian law violations are no joke. Let this test be a work of art which brings awareness to this crucial (but oftentimes ignored (by countries) and joked about (by iFunny users)) aspect of public international law. For more information, please check out the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions" target="_blank">ICRC's Website</a>. Thank you :)</p>
    <p>As another warning, this test is most likely not exhaustive. More things will come up. In such a case, I will create an additional section after the additional protocols. I will of course increase the score. I am unable to efficiently verify 127 questions, so if there's a problem please reach out! I am sure a lot of people are better at spotting my mistakes than I am.</p>
    <p>Here is how the test works. If you have done what is said in the checkbox, you check it. Interpret it as you wish. After all, law is an inexact science. Theoretically speaking, all of these boxes normally apply to IAC by default, but here if nothing is written about IAC or NIAC, presume it applies to both as objectively a breach is still a breach. The final score you're given is a score out of 127. As you check each box, the score updates live below. People who are completely clean have 0 out of 127. Have fun.</p>
    <p>Thank you to the Rice Purity Test, absolutely amazing idea. Thank you to ChatGPT for coding the javascript thing it genuinely makes my brain overheat to try and understand what's written.</p>

    <h4>Dictionary</h4>
    <p>Is considered <b>hors de combat</b> anybody injured and unable to continue to take part in combat. <br>
        <b>Medical personnel</b> means those persons assigned, by a Party to the conflict, exclusively to medical purposes. <br>
        <b>Religious personnel</b> means military or civilian persons, such as chaplains, who are exclusively engaged in the work of their ministry. <br>
        <b>Shipwrecked</b> means persons, whether military or civilian, who are in peril at sea or in other waters as a result of misfortune affecting them or the vessel or aircraft carrying them and who refrain from any act of hostility. <br>
        <b>Wounded and sick</b> categorizes people, military or civilian, injured or unstable mentally or physically, who need medical assistance. <br>
        As a rule of thumb, to check who is protected by the convention, look at the glossary of abbreviations and see what the convention protects. For example, for the Fourth Geneva Convention, protected persons are civilians. Normally everything you need to know should be within the test somewhere, if not, the internet is your friend.
