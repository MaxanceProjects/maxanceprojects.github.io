    <h1>MAXANCEPROJECTS IS CURRENTLY UNDER FULL MAINTENANCE</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, due to technical difficulties or website changes of a major scale, maintenance must be made. Do not worry, every single file has been backed up, removed, and will later be re-introduced once the changes are made. More informations are provided below.</p>
    <p>The website should be running relatively soon, please contact Max at <a href="mailto:15mania.squarecraft@gmail.com">15mania.squarecraft@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
    <hr style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
    <p>Reason for maintenance: <span style="color: purple;">major problem with GitHub processing folder name changes</span>.</p>
    <p>Additional information: GitHub is very case sensitive. During Alpha 2, folders have lost their capital letter and restructuring had been made. Folders which were renamed with a case change were not registered by GitHub, but since it is case sensitive it was not able to find the files. Because of this, all the files have been taken out, the repository wiped clean except this file, and will later be re-introduced.</p>
    <hr style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">
    <p>Apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
    <p>Website under maintenance since: <span style="color: purple;">September 4th 2022</span>.</p>
    <p>Previous version: <span style="color: purple;">Alpha 2.0.1</span>.</p>
