        <hr>
        <p>Please read me! This is the map's description, and guide on how to use it, plus some extra info (a very similar description is available on the map itself). Welcome to the world. This is a map made by me: Max. You can find my contact in the <a href="../../About/about.html">about</a> page of this website. Or, contact me by <a href="mailto:15mania.squarecraft@gmail.com">email</a>. This map belongs to our exploration group, which you can learn more about through the exploration portal. We also have an exploration group chat, again contact either Dev, Marlon, or myself if you wish to be added. We'd appreciate if you do not extensively share this map and only keep it between close friends for the sake of privacy and to keep these places special. </p>
        <p>To use the map, you can navigate through the window on this site, or even better, click on the full screen icon, or click the button below the frame. A layers and places menu should be visible on your left, check and uncheck boxes to see layers. To see an item, click on it on the map or in the menu. A place has a title, a description, and images in some cases. The title provides an ID (see below for IDs and Icons) as well as the name of the place. Places have coordinates using multiple systems (mainly decimal coordinates).</p>

        <h1>Some additional information and disclaimers:</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>This map lacks some accuracy, although I promise, the stories I've written, and the locations are as accurate as they can be. Some of these places have not been verified, only visited by other explorers and mapmakers - this is specified in the description. I apologize for any inaccuracies, I promise I'm visiting and informing myself as much as possible. By the off chance that even the slightest inaccuracy does occur, I apologize. Be sure to contact me if you have any corrections to make or any suggestions :)</p>
        <p>This map gets updated a lot. I really mean a lot. You can see the view count right under the description. Currently it's at almost 600 views. Keep in mind that around 90% if not more of those views are from me. There are times when I check this map virtually every day. I regularly go on exploring trips and always have some kind of information to bring back. Additionally, this map was created over a year ago (was created on July 29th 2019) back when I didn't necessarily have as much places to put; because of that I added random and not necessarily "relevant" places. Some places just aren't that interesting, some completely got wiped off the map. These places and IDs get changed around because places get deleted more re-classified. If you're planning to use this on a trip, or for informing yourself if you consider this that insightful, please check the map the day you're beginning the endeavor as changes happen more often than you think.</p>
        <p>Here are some websites you might benefit from: <a href="http://meteo.search.ch" target="_blank">Meteo Search</a> for anything weather related (hour by hour graphs, wind and temperature maps, etc...), the <a href="https://drinkingwater.directory/en" target="_blank">Drinking Water Map</a> in case you're in need of water, the <a href="https://map.geo.admin.ch" target="_blank">Swiss Topographic Map</a> which is Switzerland's national map, <a href="https://map.schweizmobil.ch" target="_blank">SchweizMobil/SuisseMobile/SwitzerlandMobility</a> which is the national map but with layers dedicated to hikes biking and so much more, the <a href="https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/carte" target="_blank">French National Geographic Institute (IGN) Map</a> which is France's national map, <a href="https://cbovd.ch/index.php/naturando2" target="_blank">NatuRando II</a> which is a collection of marked paths in the Vaud Canton. More resources which help me in my research and which might be relevant to you are in other sections of the exploring portal. Lastly, here's a God Tier website which is excellent for helping you plan trips, full of pictures and awesome maps: <a href="https://visinand.ch" target="_blank">click here</a>. <b>All the websites and sources I use are in the <a href="">resources section</a>.</b> With that said, happy exploring!</p>
