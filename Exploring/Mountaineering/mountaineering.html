    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This page is dedicated to hiking and mountaineering. This isn't a big in detail guide, however it's hopefully a useful guide. As this section evolves, different sections for each mountain range and area will be available. This is a lengthy process, however. Access to some might already possible, located above this text, in which case, you can simply click on the images and they'll bring you to the needed category. Otherwise, scroll below for local info.</p>
    
    <h3>Difficulty table</h3>
    
    <p>A completely subjective classification of how difficult a hike is. No this isn't a climbing difficulty grading system, it's just for planning purposes. Each route has a difficulty rating. Depending on the rating you may need to prepare differently. What does this system take into account?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distance</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>Elevation change</li>
        <li>Steepness</li>
        <li>Average road (quality, width, etc.)</li>
        <li>Average terrain (mainly quality)</li>
        <li>Needed material</li>
        <li>Needed skill</li>
        <li>Level of risk</li>
        <li>How tired someone is by the time they reach the end</li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is purely subjective, although it's fairly helpful for organizing a hike and knowing if it's fit for you and the folks you're bringing along. However, this doesn't take into account certain particularities or "quirks" of the place. For example, Le Noirmont is a place where you have to be mindful of herding/guard dogs in the area, this isn't taken into account. It just appeals to experience, knowledge, and physical capability. Put in a lot of planning before going somewhere, no matter where that somewhere is, don't do anything stupid even if the path is rated 1.</p>
    <p>Anything above 10 is in white, not only so that you can see the text better, but because it gets into expert level waters. So basically, if you're the average hiker, you can use this scale out of 10 if you want to, and it won't make much of a difference (chances are you'll feel more accomplished when you get to that rating 10 because it's the top of the scale in a way).</p>
    
    <h3>Geography</h3>
    <p>A quick synthesis of everything geography is coming soon, I just need to learn how to draw a map in ms paint and dedicate a moderate amount of time to it.</p>
