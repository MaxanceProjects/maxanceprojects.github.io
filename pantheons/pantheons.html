    <p>Important note: not everyone is recognized by a small amount of pantheons. If there is enough requests for a pantheon with enough suggested content to put in, I'll happily do it. Don't judge the choices, make your own pantheon if you ain't happy just like do <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> and then <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and then <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or something idk. All pictures are given appropriate credit and I think I did enough research to use them.</p>

    <h3>List of things I like</h3>
    <p>The most complete (but not most updated) list of everything I like. It used to be in a shared notes file, then it moved to Obsidian, now it's here for good.</p>

    <h3>YouTube pantheon</h3>
    <p>A decently sized collection of content and content creators that I recommend to many and enjoy.</p>

    <!-- Gigachad pantheon is currently a work in progress as I need to figure out image licenses-->
    <!-- <h3>Gigachad pantheon</h3>
    <p>A large collection of great men and their stories for young men to inspire themselves and learn a bit about history. Important: the pictures are sourced from elsewhere on the internet and are hopefully appropriately cited and used. This means that they aren't resized, so don't load this on mobile data!</p>
