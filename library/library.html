                <p>One day I decided to come up with four laws of motion (inspired by Newton’s of motion). It’s a bit disappointing to hear but these had nothing to do with motion at all. Given that I like to share my projects, I decided that hey, why not share this on my website. With time some stuff changed here and there. The idea is that these “laws” are sometimes useless, sometimes stupid, sometimes both, but sometimes they have a glimmer of insight. I’d like to take that further and say that perhaps all of these have some kind of insight that would be relevant someday because in every bit of knowledge there lies some kind of thing whose power has not been discovered yet but might one day… nahhh I’m kidding I have complete creative freedom with this it’s really just for fun. It makes for good reasoning exercises and it also keeps my math and logic skills sharp.</p>

                <p>Having started in January 2020, my journal recounts a lot of historical events, opinions, and all sorts of other things too. These journals are classified, but I'm very proud of them so I'm gonna share their existence here. The collection of books listed below is what is called the "general journal," meaning that it has the bulk of all information that I have ever written down. There can also be "specialized" journals, such as my dream journal or my journal of spiritual places. They don't tell the full picture, unlike the general journals listed below. The pages of this journal cannot be shared. I can, however, give out some information from a certain date if needed. This is reserved for people who are close to me. This is the current list of volumes which have been <b>completed</b>:</p>
