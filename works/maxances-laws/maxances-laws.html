    <br>
    <h3>Law I</h3>
    <p><i>The linear formula for the equation ax+b = 0 is -b/a.</i></p>
    <p>The law is illustrated and explained by the following formulae:</p>

    <p>This formula is particularly special as it can be used both for solving an equation but also used in relation to find something cool about the "polynomial" of highest degree 1 (in relation to the xth law). This is not the case for a quadratic equation as the formula to solve for x and the x coordinate of something cool formula are very different.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Law II</h3>
    <p><i>How good a grade is is directly proportional to the grade.</i></p>
    <p>The law is illustrated by a formula as follows:</p>
